# Project Management Module Database Schema Migration
"""
This file would contain Alembic migration scripts for creating the project management
database tables. The migration would include:

Tables to be created:
- pm_projects (main project information)
- pm_tasks (task management)
- pm_project_phases (project timeline phases)
- pm_milestones (project milestones)
- pm_team_members (project team assignments)
- pm_calendar_events (universal calendar)
- pm_time_logs (time tracking)
- pm_comments (project/task comments)
- pm_notifications (notification system)
- pm_deadline_alerts (deadline monitoring)
- pm_project_dependencies (project relationships)
- pm_resource_allocations (resource management)
- pm_budget_tracking (financial tracking)

Key features:
- Foreign key relationships to hr.employees and auth.users
- Indexes for performance optimization
- Constraints for data integrity
- Audit fields (created_at, updated_at, created_by, updated_by)
- Soft delete support (is_deleted, deleted_at)

Migration would be created using:
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Create project management tables"
"""

# Sample migration structure (would be generated by Alembic):

def upgrade():
    """Create project management tables"""
    pass

def downgrade():
    """Drop project management tables"""
    pass
